    \* This time must be enough for the algoritm to converge. If the model checking fails with a divergence/collision
    \* error, one possible reason is that the time was not sufficient for the network to converge.
    \* Remember that the model incorporates clock rate skew which in the worst case may cause a few back-and-forth
    \* evictions before a stable configuration is found.
